### Change records in GraphQL
    mutation {                                                  # Every change request starts with the keyword mutation
      setTrailStatus(id: "goosebumps" status: CLOSED) {         # Change goosebumps status to closed
        name                                                    # Return name and status of goosebumps after modification
        status
      }
    }

        ...details                                              # Fragment name used here
      }
    }

    fragment details on Lift {                                  # Fragment definition
      id                                                        # Add all fields
