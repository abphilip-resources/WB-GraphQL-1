### General Query in GraphQL
    query {                               # Every request starts with the keyword query
      liftCount                           # Number of lifts from the database
      allLifts {                          # Return name and capacity from all lifts
        name
        capacity
      }
    }

### Enum - Restricted list of options for a field
    query {
      liftCount (status: OPEN)            # Return number of lifts with status OPEN
      allLifts {
        name
        capacity
      }
    }

### Alias - A different name for a field when there are conflicting arguments in the same query
    query {
      open: liftCount(status: OPEN)       # Return number of lifts with status OPEN
      closed: liftCount(status: CLOSED)   # Return number of lifts with status CLOSED
      allLifts {
        name
        capacity
      }
    }

### Variable - Using a variable to pass in a value
    query ($status: LiftStatus) {
      liftCount (status: $status)         # Return number of lifts with status entered by user
      allLifts {
        name
        capacity
      }
    }

    # Variables can be passed in as a JSON object
    {
      "status": "OPEN"
    }
