### General Query in GraphQL
    query {                               # Every request starts with the keyword query
      liftCount                           # Number of lifts from the database
      allLifts {                          # Return name and capacity from all lifts
        name
        capacity
      }
    }

### Enum - Restricted list of options for a field
    query {
      liftCount (status: OPEN)            # Return number of lifts with status OPEN
      allLifts {
        name
        capacity
      }
    }

### Alias - Multiple names for a field when there are conflicting arguments in the same query
    query {
      open: liftCount(status: OPEN)       # Return number of lifts with status OPEN
      closed: liftCount(status: CLOSED)   # Return number of lifts with status CLOSED
      allLifts {
        name
        capacity
      }
    }

### Variable - Pass values using JSON objects
    query ($status: LiftStatus) {
      liftCount (status: $status)         # Return number of lifts with status entered by user
      allLifts {
        name
        capacity
      }
    }

    {
      "status": "OPEN"
    }

### Multiple Queries - Executing individually differentiated with operation names
    query Lifts {                         # Query 1 named Lifts
      allLifts {                          # Returns lift details
        name
        status
      }
    }

    query Trails {                        # Query 2 named Trails
      allTrails {                         # Returns trail details
        name
        status
      }
    }
