### General Query in GraphQL

query {                         # Every request starts with the keyword query
  liftCount                     # Number of lifts from the database
  allLifts {                    # Return name and capacity from all lifts
    name
    capacity
  }
}

### Enum - Restricted list of options for a field

query {
  liftCount (status: OPEN)      # Return number of lifts with status OPEN
  allLifts {
    name
    capacity
  }
}

### Alias - A different name for a field when there are conflicting arguments in the same query

query {
  liftCount (status: OPEN)      
  allLifts {
    name
    capacity
  }
}
